# Open University MSc project for F77 Space Science and Technology for Daniel Bhuglah

## Research question

Can 60cm class ground-based telescopes and appropriate processing pipelines deliver sufficient precision and accuracy to differentiate between the possible causes of Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) for transiting Neptunian/sub-Jovian exoplanets? 

If possible, the project will also consider if this class of telescope can detect Transit Duration Variations (TDVs) and Transit dePth Variation (TPVs).

## Why is this interesting?

This project will challenge the limits of PIRATE’s capabilities, and require that any best practices identified that maximise the quality of results (across analysis software packages) are documented for future reference. If successful, this would lead to an expansion of the inventory of exoplanets that 60cm telescopes (including PIRATE) can observe and may result in additional research opportunities. 
In turn, this leads to an increase in: 
* Processing  capacity to accommodate the expected growth of exoplanet data driven by missions such as  ARIEL, PLATO and PANDORA.  
* Results consistency by setting baseline standards across the process pipelines allowing for the industrialisation of analysis efforts.

Additionally, it is hoped that the results can contribute to the ExoCLock and EXPLORE programs.

## What lead me here?

With a 30+ year career in financial services technology (as a BA/PM), I was often asked to do “more with less” and extract the maximum value out of  our technology stack. It would be interesting to see if I can apply those skills to a new field, even one that is as cool as space and exoplanets.
